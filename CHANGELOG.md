###PkmGCTools v1.1:
* GBA Pokémon are now **fully** supported.
* As a consequence onversion between Colosseum, XD and GBA Pokémon is now **fully** supported. 
	* It is done (almost) exactly like it is in Colosseum/XD during a GC<->GBA trade (meaning, for example, that the data specific to shadow Pokémon is lost).
	* Please note that A-Save discards all party-related information (e.g status alteration). The Devil is in the detail...
* The maximum number for items has been raised to 999.
* Some bug fixes (Strategy Memo edition now working properly etc...).
* PkmGCSaveEditor now has an icon!
