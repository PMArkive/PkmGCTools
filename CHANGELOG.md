###PkmGCTools v1.1.1:
Fixed a lot of critical bugs (affecting IVs, etc...). Money and Pokécoupons are now limited to 9,999,999. Bag items are limited again to 99 in Pokémon Colosseum. 

To users of previous versions:
* If and only if you have modified a Colosseum save file with that previous version, please load this save file again, 
and click "Bugs affecting Pokémon..."(in "Options", "Bug fixes"). Do it only once and only once (for each concerned save file).
* If you have imported or exported a Pokémon in the GBA format, please check its status alteration, its EVs, and its game of origin. 

###PkmGCTools v1.1:
* GBA Pokémon are now **fully** supported.
* As a consequence conversion between Colosseum, XD and GBA Pokémon is now **fully** supported. 
	* It is done (almost) exactly like it is in Colosseum/XD during a GC<->GBA trade (meaning, for example, that the data specific to shadow Pokémon is lost).
	* Please note that A-Save discards all party-related information (e.g status alteration). The Devil is in the detail...
* The maximum number for items has been raised to 999.
* Some bug fixes (Strategy Memo edition now working properly etc...).
* PkmGCSaveEditor now has an icon!
